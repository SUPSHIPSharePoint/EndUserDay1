**SHAREPOINT 2013 END USER TRAINING PREREQUISITES**

Attendees should have experience using a Web browser and interacting with Web-based systems. Some experience with Microsoft Office (any version) as well as experience with a previous version of SharePoint is a plus, but not required.

**SHAREPOINT 2013 END USER TRAINING MATERIALS**

All attendees receive a copy of Microsoft's SharePoint 2013 Step by Step.

**SOFTWARE NEEDED FOR EACH PC:**

-   Microsoft Office Professional 2013 (or 2010 if necessary), with the latest updates.

-   Internet Explorer 9 or higher.

-   For classes delivered online, all participants need either dual monitors or a separate device logged into the online session so that they can do their work on one screen and watch the instructor on the other. A separate computer connected to a projector or large screen TV would be another way for students to see the instructor's screen simultaneously with working on their own.
